                                A little about me, I am currently a 5th semester computer engineering student at Multimedia Nusantara University Jakarta. My personality is INFJ, yes I am an introvert person. But I am active in organizations and activities on my campus. I became one of the association administrators for my study program. And I once ran for chairman of the association, unfortunately I lost the vote but it was one of my best experiences and improved my soft skills. I participate in many activities while offline, but because of the pandemic I became sad because of the limitations.<br/>
                                I like exploring new things, and I'm currently interested in cloud computing, decentralized computing, blockchain, and large networks. I think that's the future to pursue. no longer people connected but all devices connected.<br/><br/>
                                Here are a few Highlights:<br/>
                                - Full stack web developer<br/>
                                - Android Java &amp; kotlin developer<br/>
                                - Cloud system administration<br/>
                                - Tensorflow &amp; Keras for image processing<br/>
                                - IoT Engineer
